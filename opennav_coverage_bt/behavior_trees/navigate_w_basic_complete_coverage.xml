<!--
  This Behavior Tree computes a complete coverage path over a selected space, then follows it.
  Can also take the coverage_path instead of Nav Path for segmented swaths from turns
  for changes in operational modes (e.g. raise tool, turn off payload in turns not in field).

  Field filepath is set by the Navigator plugin in the action request, but also may be hardcoded
  or set using the polygons input port instead for dynamically computed values instead of from file
-->
